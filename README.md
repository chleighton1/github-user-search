## Overview

### About

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes

## My process

My first time implementing light and dark mode. I used a combination of Next Themes and Tailwind CSS to style in dark mode. I found this approach very straighforward and will most likely continue to use it for future projects.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
